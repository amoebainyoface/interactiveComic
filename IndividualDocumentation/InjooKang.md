# Normalcy Test
## Are you a "normal" NYUAD student?
Have you ever wondered what is considered "normal" in NYUAD? Is it normal to eat alone in D2? Is it normal to decline party invites and choose to stay in your room? How should a "normal" student behave on this campus? "Normalcy Test" twists this belief that we must fit into the common norms. The project initially invites users to test their normalcy by answering how they would behave in the given situations. In the end, however, the website delivers a message that every individual is unique and there is no need to struggle to fit into the socially constructed normalcy.

## Reflection and Evaluation 
Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.
Process: How did you go about implementing the concept. Describe your role and what your contribution was.
Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
